# sync-codex-marketplace-plugin.sh
#
# Regenerates plugins/token-optimizer/ (the Codex marketplace plugin directory)
# from the canonical repo-root content: skills/, hooks/, and .codex-plugin/plugin.json.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS:
#   Codex CLI 0.136.0 only resolves marketplace plugins that live in a SUBDIRECTORY
#   (./plugins/<name>), not at the repo root. So .agents/plugins/marketplace.json
#   points at ./plugins/token-optimizer via a `local` source. That nested directory
#   must contain REAL content — Codex's install copy does NOT follow symlinks, so a
#   symlinked skills/ installs as an empty plugin. The canonical source stays at the
#   repo root (consumed by install.sh / Claude Code); this script mirrors it into the
#   nested Codex plugin dir.
#
# WHY hooks/ IS INCLUDED:
#   The installed skill's own setup scripts (skills/token-optimizer/scripts/
#   codex_install.py and codex_doctor.py) locate hooks via `Path(__file__).parents[3]`
#   = the plugin root, e.g. `<plugin_root>/hooks/python-launcher.sh`. If hooks/ is not
#   shipped at the nested plugin root, Codex hook setup resolves to a missing path and
#   silently breaks. So hooks/ ships alongside skills/.
#
# Run before any release that touches skills/, hooks/, or the Codex plugin version.
# Enforcement: scripts/sign-release.sh regenerates the mirror and `git diff --quiet --
# plugins/token-optimizer`, aborting the release if the committed mirror drifted. Run this
# script locally to refresh the mirror before committing.
# Idempotent: running on an in-sync tree produces no git diff.
